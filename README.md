# Arusha Consulting

## Live App 

A live version of the app can be accessed [here](https://www.arushainc.com/). 

## Summary 

I built this full-stack web application for a recent client. The client, Arusha Consulting, is a boutique consulting firm with a focus on promoting diversity within the workplace. This website allows Arusha Consulting to communicate with users via About, Blog, and Contact pages. I implemented a headless CMS to allow the client to manage their own content. The project also includes a crowd-sourced database that holds informative resources concerning numerous social justice issues.

### Please Note

This is the repository for the Arusha Consulting client. This project also consists of the arusha-consulting-proxy and arusha-consulting-api repositories. The latter are made private for security purposes.
